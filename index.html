                <h3>Project 1: Web Page Development</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to developing a single Web page using only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The individual project consists in creating a single web page with a menu at the top known as the Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and text describing the project. The project helped develop my skills in coding HTML and CSS files.</p>

                <h3>Project 2: Developing Rover Scanner Code</h3>
                <p>The second project utilized the CyBot, a roomba equipped with a microcontroller and scanner. The two-person project consists of writing code to allow the CyBot the capability to scan a 180 degree field for objects and display the distances, angle, and widths of the objects on the terminal. The project took into practice our skills in debugging our program.</p>

            <p>I believe the purpose of having a Code of Ethics is to be able to hold ourselves to reliable standards that will prevent our work from being exploited. Many of the IEEE Code of Ethics involve maintaining safety and quality of character by warning against conflicts of interest, bribery, and damaging reputations or property. As technology develops, it is important to not let decisions involving these developments negatively impact ourselves or others. So, a Code of Ethics provides a good baseline on what type of decisions to avoid and help individuals and companies reflect on outcomes that their decisions could potentially have in various ethical situations. A way I would personally go about making a decision would be to reflect on all applicable Code of Ethics as I would want to ensure I can avoid violating any of them if possible. In circumstances where I am not the only person making decisions, I will bring up Code of Ethics and attempt to find common ground with others to determine an effective solution to the situation that will not inflict on my own or others’ Code of Ethics. </p>
            <p>One of the ethical issues discussed in class was the Big Data Issue, in which a contract computer scientist, Marcus, assists the SMART Research Group in building a database for job-related injuries to paramedics. Marcus is brought to a dilemma of following his Code of Ethics to protect personally identifiable information (PII) at the risk of possibly losing his contract. Of the six Virtue of Ethics, the three that I feel most related to this issue was integrity, fidelity, and responsibility. In this situation, integrity and fidelity go hand-in-hand with Marcus’s need to uphold his own Code of Ethics. The fidelity aspect is also split between Marcus needing to believe in his Code of Ethics while also supporting the demands of his superiors. For the responsibility aspect, a solution I proposed for this issue during discussion was for Marcus to discuss with his superior on how to include the data while also removing the PII. Through this solution, it relates to the tenth IEEE Code of Ethics to assist colleagues in following the code of ethics. From Marcus following the Code of Ethics, it would be his responsibility to ensure that his superior also follows the Code of Ethics. I felt that charity and honesty were less relevant to this issue due to most of the situation involving Marcus’s reliance on his Code of Ethics.</p>
